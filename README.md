# FilterCamera
A library to filter image or camera for Android.

This is an idea from [android-gpuimage](https://github.com/CyberAgent/android-gpuimage).
#
You can add an new Filter copy from #android-gpuimage# and then change to this project's style.

`remove the define of inputImageTexture in shader`
